# Project: Building With Active Record (Micro-Reddit)

This is the micro-reddit app from the RoR tutorial on The Odin Project

Checkout the full assignment description on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-with-active-record-ruby-on-rails#project-2-micro-reddit)

## Built With

- Ruby on Rails
- Html & CSS
- Postgresql

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

If you wish, you could use my seed file to generate mock data. This will create random users and posts.


```
$ rails db:seed
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
